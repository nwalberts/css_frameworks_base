# CSS Frameworks

The aim of frameworks in general is to provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch.

CSS frameworks:
- allow for quicker and easier styling
- provide a cohesive, semi-polished look right off the bat
- are super easy to install!
- help with mobile-friendly layouts

Note: The original version of this repo was created by cmkoller. I have developed this code base so that students and I can have a basic and completed version to work with.
